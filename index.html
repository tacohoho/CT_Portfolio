            <p>Hi! I'm 21 years old and I am currently a college student pursuing a degree in computer science. 
                I have decided to take a small break from school and took this coding bootcamp in order to solidify my programming skills</p>

            <p>Basketball is a sport I started playing a few years back because of my friends and I've kept playing since. If you ever play against me, just know you can't leave me open :)</p>
